Welcome! I am social policy doctoral student at Oxford University. My research currently focuses on the interactions between housing policy and labour markets. 
My main research interests include:
  • Housing policy
  • Labor market institutions
  • Social inequality
  • Welfare state comparison
  • Political economy

====

Moreover, I am a College Tutor for Social Policy (SP224) working with Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) students.
I have also joined a member of the [Demographic Change and the Intergenerational Persistence in Homeownership in Europe (DECIPHE)](https://www.deciphe.eu/) research team.

My academic experiences inexorably moved me from economics towards social policy. After the BSc in Economics at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/en), I continued my graduate studies at [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) where I obtained a master degree in Economics and Philosophy. Following a few years in private and public sector consulting I went back to academia at [Oxford University DSPI](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/). Here, I first completed an MSc in Evidence-Based Policy Evalutation, and I joined the department as doctoral student in Social Policy.
